use case 1

Instructions: on the lowermost inputfield, change the value of "test" to the date you want to predict

Seeing as we are looking for a specific number, we used regression and not classification.
SupportVectorRegression is used as we feel it is best fit of the ones we tested.
It predicts a little in to the future and flatens out when it does not have recent enough data
